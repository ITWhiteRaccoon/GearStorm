<main><h3>Wake Station</h3>Wake Station is one of the few remaining EDI settlements. It's a walled city built around an
    original colony
    facility with a mix of military and commercial habitats. Facilities have fallen into disrepair. Parks have been
    repurposed for agricultural areas. The is an open air market as well as abandoned military and industrial areas.
    What we see here is the Military section. Its neighbored by farms in the North & North West.

    It's under construction. Seen here is HQ, the Motor Pool, and some housing.
