<main><h3>Sol-Terra Expedition</h3>The Sol-Terra Expedition (STE)- Departed ~2800 AD. Arrived ~3000 AD. Who knows?

    Not much is known on Apollyon about the Sol-Terra Imperium or it's one Expedition to Apollyon. The STE settlements
    date from around 3000 AD and on, making the STE the first human expedition to arrive on Apollyon. However, no known
    survivors of this expedition remain on Apollyon - if indeed any were ever sent.

    But the advanced technology of many STE sites remains as ruins scattered throughout the planet.
    <h4>Technology</h4>The STE technology is often beyond our current understanding of the universe as it is. Some
    believe they used direct
    tachyonic teleportation while others postulate gravity-based time manipulation (vaguely Tardis-like) as their means
    of achieving FTL.
    It's all anyone's guess though as no STE landing craft have ever been found. The remaining, barely functional
    technological systems on Apollyon are dangerous and hotly desired.
    <h4>Locations</h4>The old Endor Colony ruins are near an ancient STE site and were wiped out by the defense system
    that the MSF colony
    unleashed on itself. There are many other STE ruins around Apollyon though. Some are known, most are not.
    <h4>Factions</h4>The STE has no living members nor active intelligences currently. So the STE isn't really a faction
    of Apollyon
    per-se. This can sometimes change though when ancient systems activate. The fate of the Sol-Terra Imperium is
    unknown, but their ability to travel to Apollyon doesn't rule them out as a faction either. Assuming the Imperium is
    even still around.
