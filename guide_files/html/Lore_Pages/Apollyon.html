<h3>Apollyon</h3>"Apollyon...what a cruel fate, that man's second Eden would be named so. That such a grim name
comes from the
highest bidder's list is, I find, a most fitting start to its prophecy of our destruction." -Jorg Neuman,
Astrophysicist. 2191 AD.

The primary location of Gearstorm. Apollyon is an exo-planet located 12LY away from Earth. It resides in the
habitable zone and boasts a human-compatible biosphere. Despite its miraculous status and location, Apollyon is a
modest planet of large oceans and small land-masses. A distant cousin of our own, this pale blue dot daringly shines
its brightest among the vast loneliness of space.

<h4>Discovery</h4>In 2156 AD, the Automated Kepler Systems Array--the humblest of exploration projects--made a
historic discovery. It
was a planet with an Earth-Similarity Index of 0.98, almost perfect.
Nanoprobes were dispatched at 18% the speed of light and their readings of the planet returned to
Earth in 2191 AD.
They were far more than we expected. By all readings and deductions, this new world had a fully
functioning,
human-compatible biosphere with breathable air. And it was only about twelve light-years away.

The automated system chose a name from its donor-determined list and mankind’s miracle second Earth
was name
Apollyon. But the miracle wouldn’t last.

The prize of Apollyon was too rich for the international peace to withstand. Nationalistic movements
gained power
from the over-crowded populations who were desperate to claim the open frontier of Apollyon for
themselves.
Demagogues gained power and diplomacy was replaced by posturing as powerful once-allies rattled
their sabers at each
other.

By 2196 AD, the world was in a state of multiple cold wars between the four powers. Proxy wars over
smaller nations
and ideologies caught fire across the globe. Fearing for their safety, the many nations of Earth
began to spin a
horrible web of hidden alliances and defensive treaties.

In 2197 AD, the Secretary-General of the UN, fearing that global war was nearing, held an immense
diplomatic summit
at the Tetragon moon base. Called The Reminder Speech ingloriously, it was a heavy-handed affair
which desperately
tried to focus the world’s leaders on what they could do together.

The summit worked initially. The G20 leaders present ratified an international treaty banning all
independent
colonization efforts. They promised that all would reach Apollyon, or none would. To that end, the
International
Colonization Authority was founded and charged with the task of starting a colony on Apollyon. All
participating
countries donated funds, manpower, and resources to it and the effort was placed under the UN’s
oversight.

But peace was not to be had. Even with the biggest countries on Earth in outward agreement, many
others would not
listen. Political tensions continued to rise. By 2199 AD, numerous countries around the world
started developing
militarized space forces, in violation of all treaties counter to such. In the end, everyone knew
the first to get
to Apollyon would have a chance at winning it all.

2200 AD, was a big year for the UN’s peace push. Using the century anniversary as a coming together
moment, the UN
made a huge show of giving the ICA full ownership of the Tetragon Moon Base for use in constructing
the first legal
colony ship – The Vanguard. Assembly of the titanic vessel began that same year, albeit at a rushed
pace for the
show.

For a few months, people breathed easily. Then, in 2201 AD, a military satellite was accidentally
shot down by
another country’s space force during routine practice. The circumstances of who was at fault aren’t
clear, but the
international incident nearly brought the two countries to war.

Before hands could shake on a de-escalation meeting, the country who owned the satellite used the
international
focus on the peace talks to launch an illegal colony ship from Earth. It’s neighbor’s missile system
shot the craft
down, raining debris over a coastal city, lighting fires, and killing hundreds.

By the next year, 2203 AD, both countries were building up troops on their borders and skirmishes by
deniable proxy
troops were already heating up the theater of war. Peace talks failed in 2204 AD when a war was
officially declared
as a means of stopping the one county’s illegal colonization program.

This war triggered defensive treaties, which triggered hidden accords. The worrisome web of
confusing and secretive
agreements dragged the whole world down to war. Allies and enemies switched sides rapidly in the
first year as the
battle lines resolved.

Full-scale global war truly started in 2205 AD, when a nuclear exchange went down between
super-powers. Then another
super-power revealed that it had broken the ban on robotic armies. Everyone with illegal
colonization programs tried
to flee Earth and a series of brutal executions of their ships were televised from space as
deterrents.

Around 2207 AD, nuclear weapons had driven the war underground or into bunkered mountain cities.
Robot armies
clashed across the radioactive wastelands of Earth’s surface while people fought savage battles in
tunnel-warfare.
World War 3 reached a gridlock. Looking to break the deadlock, someone created a biological weapon.
Who it was is
lost, or perhaps unknown, to history. The Phage they created, however, was the ultimate weapon.

The Phage spread by multiple vectors. It incubated for weeks without symptoms. Detecting it was
expensive and
difficult, especially for the war-taxed medical systems. When it did manifest, the Phage would erupt
from its
victims as it transformed them into violent, hyper-strong zombie-like monsters.

Within a year of its start, by 2209 AD, the Phage had put an end to World War 3. We were forced to
stop fighting
each other and instead battle the uncountable hordes of Phage. The fate of mankind was on the line.

In 2210 AD, Mars declared itself independent of Earth and rallied its merger space force to enact a
blockage. This
action ended what little resupply the Martian colonies had been receiving from Earth still and the
Red Planet’s
colonies descended into one of the most brutal famines in human history.

Around 2212 AD, the Phage infection caught fire on one of the moon’s several military bases. Fearing
that the end of
mankind was near, the ICA staff at the Tetragon declared their independence and cut off all contact
with the outside
world. They proceeded to pour all remaining resources into getting the Vanguard launch ready.

On Oct 13th, 2213 AD, the second to last moon base falls to the Phage and the ICA turns to defend
their stronghold
alone. The battle is hopeless though. The ICA, short on enough fuel to get the Vanguard to Apollyon,
makes a
monumental decision – the Vanguard wouldn’t carry people to Apollyon, but it would carry the means
of making people
once it gets there.

The once glorious Vanguard was stripped bare. Only the bioprinters, cloning technology, and cloning
materials were
left. Instead of sending mankind’s greatest minds into space, the skills and memories of ICA’s best
personnel were
recorded instead.

In the care of an AI named Julia, the ship was launched mere hours before the Phage overwhelmed the
Tetragon’s
defenses. Bearing with it the tiny flickering flame believed to be the last spark of humankind.

Apollyon is an Earth-like planet with a human-compatible biosphere. Please be warned: That does not
mean
human-friendly biosphere. It just means that people won't die instantly from breathing the air (in
general) or
standing on the ground under the default gravity (in general).
Almost all the data on the planet's geography and geology comes from remote probe scans and are
limited to what
advanced algorithms can deduce from orbital survey data exclusively. Specific on-the-ground
intelligence is slim.
There's no good mapping of volcanic activity and countless undiscovered natural phenomena lurk under
clouds,
forests, and jungles. It's a whole new world after all.

Here's what we know of Apollyon's biomes, in the broadest sense.
<h4>Forest</h4>A mix of old-growth hardwoods and conifers the likes of which Earth hasn't had in thousands of
years. The forests of
Apollyon are primal and they're rich with useful animals and plants. Unfortunately useful plants and
animals are
usually also eaten by bigger animals. The lush forests also lay in the foothills of mountains so
they provide no
vantage points while the trees and brush provide cover for attackers. Will you risk the forests for
their riches?
"So we called this one Raptrax 'the big f-ing lizard'. He and I have had a lot of goes at each
other. Then something
ate him. It wasn't me. Yeah, we moved base up to the Tundra shortly thereafter..." -Lt Rainer of the
ICA Colony.
<ol class="uk-list">
    <li>Flora: Bladegrass? umm.. what else?</li>
    <li>Fauna: Apollyon Faun, Rhinolope, Raptrax, and the dreaded Tyrax (on occasion).</li>
</ol>
<h4>Desert</h4>As hot and dry as any seasoned explorer would expect, the deserts of Apollyon are places where
wind and sand have
exposed the geological history of the planet. One such desert shows off Apollyon's crust via
enormous weathered
pillars of stone.
Game Tip: The pillars of rock in the desert have steep sides and are easy to burrow into for
quick mining or
base-building. The wide and flat terrain makes for easy vehicle passage.

The deserts are home to cactus-like plants and other spiky flora. Though the most famous
inhabitants are the giant,
highly territorial scorpions. Travelers beware.
<ol class="uk-list">
    <li>Flora: Cacti</li>
    <li>Fauna: Scorpax. (You've been warned.)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Tundra</h4>Found in the steep alpine regions of the planet, the tundra is a woodsy place of tall
conifers and snow. They are a
cold, steep place to live and the mountainous nature of their location makes for difficult
building (lack of flat
land). However, the view can't be beaten and there's plentiful wood, plant, and animal
resources to use to fuel the
growth of a base.
"Why'd we settle here? It's because the tundra provides the high ground against any enemies,
it's remote, and
there's lots of meat running around just waiting for me to shove it into the grinder to make
more people. Bullshit
you say? Screw you -- the truth is that something huge lives down in the nice warm forest
and we don't want to deal
with it. So enjoy the view from the tundra and be glad you're alive." -Lt Rainer of the ICA
Colony.
<ol class="uk-list">
    <li>Flora: Bladegrass? umm.. what else?</li>
    <li>Fauna: Apollyon Faun, Rhinolope, Raptrax.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Swamps</h4>Aka, excessively moist low-lands. These stretches of insect-infested disease-breeding
terrain are technically the
kidneys of Apollyon's ecosystem. Most know them as the place they pass through to get to
the coast.
"If we ever run low on food, my plan is to just drive through the swamp and hang a bug
net out the window. That otta
get a few pounds of something real quick." -Lt. Rainer
<ol class="uk-list">
    <li>Flora: ??</li>
    <li>Fauna: ??</li>
</ol>
<h4>Coastline</h4>The coastline is a lovely stretch of rocky sand and waves. It's beautiful and one
can gaze out over the expanse of
the ocean, but it's also a boundary. The oceans of Apollyon are vast and primal.
Translation: Here be dragons. No
one sails on the oceans of Apollyon because seafarers get eaten. It doesn't matter
how big of a boat you build
either, there's always something larger in the sea.
"I'd like to go fishing sometime, but the winch on the tank is only rated at
10,000lbs." -AgriScience Specialist
Harvey of the ICA Colony.

<h4>Mountains</h4>The high peaks of Apollyon can get very high, very snowy, and very sharp. Going
over them in anything other than an
aircraft can be tricky. Not a lot of anything goes up above the tree line. But
hey, where else are you going to get
such a good view? And no other heights are as grand as these when it comes to
secluded summit-bases or aircraft
launch facilities.
