Building is one of the core features of GearStorm. There are a wide variety of things you can build with from the building materials, including: battlements, bridges, doors, garages, lights, walls, and more.</p></div>

<p>You can build a humble base or a massive city ino GearStorm:</p>

First you must have a build gun to build.  The build gun is the Exomarine's Swiss Army Knife, a truely multi-purpose molecular reorganizer, used for digging, resource gathering, and building.</p>

Once you have your BuildGun, you need to gather resources to build anything.  You can see what you need to build a item by clicking on it in the BuildGun menu.  Get to the BuildGun menu by equiping it and hitting "q".

If you have the resources, you are going to want to build a "Core" first.  The Core is the first thing you have to build for a base or city and tracks and maintains all the built items in the Core radius.  Without a Core, you cannot build most structures.
