<main class="uk-container uk-height-1-1 uk-overflow-auto">The Gamemaster role in GearStorm allows the player to take control of the game in almost every way. As
    Gamemaster you can teleport, fly, build unlimited things, spawn anything, ban people, kick people, teleport
    people to you, change the damage, range, and rate of fire of weapons, change the performance, damage, and armor
    of vehicles, and change the world time, weather, day cycle, etc.

    <h3>Becoming Gamemaster</h3>Here are the ways to be a Gamemaster in a GearStorm game:
    1. In the game.ini file, under the [/Script/ShooterGame.ServerSettings] section, set the "+ServerAdmin=" value
    to the steam ID number of your admins. Add a new "+ServerAdmin=" value for each Gamemaster you want to add or
    use the "*" value to let anyone be Gamemaster (ie: "+ServerAdmin=*")

    box and to start in
    Gamemaster mode already, check the "Start in Gamemaster Mode" checkbox.

    <h3>Gamemastering</h3>To perform any Gamemaster function in GearStorm, you need to use the Gamemaster interface
    accessed by pressing
    "backspace" (default mapping)
