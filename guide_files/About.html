                    GearStorm is an upcoming game currently in development by Iron City Games.
                    <br>
                    It takes place in a militarized science fiction sandbox in which players cooperate and compete to
                    colonize and fortify their positions on a hostile alien planet. GearStorm takes place on an huge,
                    open, procedural, and entirely destructible world. Here players can advance and customize their
                    technology to improve their chances against each other and the Phage – a deadly nano-virus that is
                    decimating human population.

            <div class="uk-card-body">
                In the year, 2185, the human race is in its final death throes. Earth itself is a desolate waste,
                ravaged by
                decades of war. War, more malignant, more savage than any conceived of before. War fueled by diverging
                ideologies, waning resources, and drastic technology advances of the 21st century. For years, humanity
                bathed itself in blood, fire and death.The final death knell came in the form of the Phage. A virulent
                genetically-engineered biological weapon that weaponized the infected into rageful bio-mechanical
                horrors
                that spread the plague and death. The unstoppable Phage spread like wildfire through man and beast
                alike.
                With no way to undo what was done, the remnants of humankind retreated into bunkers, or walled cities,
                and
                fortresses. But even these, one by one fell to the Phage.
                <br><br>
                With Earth all but lost, a glimmer of hope was discovered. Automated Kepler systems that had been in
                operation for nearly a century discovered an extremely unlikely, human habitable extraterrestrial world.
                These probes reported amazing findings dozens of light-years away on a planet dubbed as Apollyon.
                Apollyon
                was a small earth-like planet with isolated continents in a large ocean. These islands showed signs of
                ecosystems, flora and fauna.
                <br><br>
                The mad rush to escape this hellish Earth, lead to tragic mishap and loss. Previous attempts to send
                manned
                generation ships to Apollyon failed either due to infighting or mechanical failure. In a final act of
                desperation, small, unmanned probes, fitted with advanced bio-printers were launched to seed Apollyon to
                save the species. These probes were encoded with the DNA and mental recordings of the finest of our
                remnants
                and cast off towards the planet.
                <br><br>
                You are one of these ghosts, a fabricant sent to an alien world to renew humanity. You carry the hopes
                and
                legacy of us all. Remember us.
