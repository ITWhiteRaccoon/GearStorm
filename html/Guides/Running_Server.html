                            power, we recommend investing in the most number of cores you can get and nothing lower than

                            listens for incoming connections on the ports listed below. Ensure your network
                            configuration allows incoming connections to these ports and directs them to the host that

                            those ports. Don't forget about the windows firewall! Just allow the "gearstormserver.exe"

                            In the example above, the entry "+ServerAdmin=*" means everyone that logs into the server is
                            admin! You can delete this line and add admins via a Steam player's 17-digit Steam ID
                            number. A Steam ID number can be seen by going to the "view my profile" option on the
                            upper-right hand side of the page and looking at the URL field. The Steam ID number is the
                            number after "https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/". Simply add new lines for each player
                            you want to be admin like the example below: +ServerAdmin=12345678912345678

                            ***If you don't remove the "+ServerAdmin=*" entry, everyone that logs into your server will
                            be admin no matter what other listing you put in!***

                            7777 are the most common ports that work.

                            You MUST forward both TCP and UDP for your server to show up on any lists. You can make sure
                            your ports are open by using the tool from portforward.com, that is, after you

                            Enter the ports that you have forwarded in the start_server.bat file you should have created
                            earlier. For example: start ShooterGameServer.exe TheIsland?listen?SessionName=

                        browser.
                        <h4>Automatic Startup</h4>
                        Windows (via Scheduled Task) You can configure a scheduled task to automatically run a batch
                        file and start the dedicated server when the system boots.
                        <ol class="uk-list">
                            <li>Open 'Task Scheduler'
                            </li>
                            <li>Create Basic Task</li>
                            <li>The 'Create Basic Task Wizard' will appear, name the task whatever you want
                            </li>
                            <li>Set the Trigger to 'When the computer starts'</li>
                            <li>Set the Action to 'Start a program'.</li>
                            <li>You will need to browse to the program/script you wish to start (which is your .BAT
                                batch file that starts your server).
                            </li>
                            <li>Depending on how your batch file works, you may need to set the "Start in (optional)"
                                path, so the working directory of your batch file is correct. (If your batch file simply
                                contains the "start ShooterGame ..." command, then you should set the "Start in
                                (optional)" path of your scheduled task to the directory that contains the batch file)
                            </li>
                            <li>Before you create the scheduled task, click the checkbox to "open properties window"
                                after it's created
                            </li>
                            <li>In the General Tab under the Security Options frame, you probably want to choose "Run
                                whether user is logged on or not"
                            </li>
                            <li>I personally checked "run with highest privileges" just in case. This might not be
                                necessary.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        After following these steps, your server should be up and running, and be automatically managed
                        by the host on startup and shutdown.

                        Updating To update the server when a new version is released, just re-copy your game from you
                        Steam directory to your server. Be sure to preserve the same files in your server's
                        "\Saved\SaveGames" directory before you copy the game over and re-copy them over the files in
                        the game directory.
                        <h4>Administrating Your Server</h4>
                        GearStorm has in-game GUI interfaces for most admin functions. By default, the "backspace" key
                        will bring up the admin menu and allow a admin to teleport himself or other players, spawn
                        anything, build fast and unlimited, fly, kick players, kill players, ban players, change weapon
                        damages, range, dropoffs for the whole server instantly, edit and create new quests, change the
                        weather instantly, change the time of day, alter the shadow lighting for every player on the
                        server instantly, send special notices to all the players, and save and load the server map. All
                        while playing the game, inside the game interface. Some built items have special admin functions
                        (for example, building cores) that you can access with "alt-e" instead of "e" (default key
                        setting). As a admin, you can use these menus to set the destructibility of blocks within a
                        core's radius or the difficulty level of the AI in that core's radius, for example.
                        <h4>Backing Up Server Data</h4>
                        To make a backup of the server data, simply copy the folder named ShooterGame/Saved (and his
                        content) to the desired backup location. This folder contains all item, social, player and world
                        data for the server. Performing a backup is recommended before updating a server to a new
                        release.
                        <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
                        <h4>Server Loses Characters or World Data Upon Restart</h4>
                        If your server isn't retaining characters or world data when it's restarted, it may not have
                        full access to the folder where it's installed. The first time the server is run, it should
                        create a folder named GearStorm/Saved containing various configuration and save files. If the
                        server has run at least once but hasn't created this folder, it may not have been able to create
                        new folders and files there. Verify that the folder where the server is installed is readable
                        and writable by the user account that actually runs the server. (For Windows servers, check the
                        status of User Account Control)

                        The server software, by default, is set-up to automatically save world data every 15 minutes. If
                        your server crashes before the first 15 minutes are up, you will not have any data saved.
