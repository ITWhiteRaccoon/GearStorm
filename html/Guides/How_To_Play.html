                                Welcome to GearStorm! This manual is a quick-start guide to how to play GearStorm and do
                                certain things in game. It will not completely cover every feature or crafting item as
                                those are covered in more detailed sections.
                                <br>
                                When first running the game, you will see several options on the first screen. If you
                                choose "Host Network Game", "Campaign", or "Survival Mode", you will be playing on your
                                own world on your own PC and you can host other players. If you choose “Join Network
                                Game”, you can play on someone else’s PC that is hosting or a dedicated server.

                            <h4>Building</h4>
                            <div class="uk-text-justify">
                                Building in GearStorm is essential for protection early in the game and hording your
                                stuff and keeping it safe later in the game. To building anything that lasts in
                                GearStorm you will first have to build a Core. The Core is the marker that claims the
                                immediate area around it of the server for you and saves your buildings (and protects
                                them if your Gamemaster has turned on Core protection). To build a Core you will need 5
                                Apatite (found as crystals growing in caves), 10 Copper (mineral outcroppings marked
                                with "Cu" on your map), and 15 Stone (just dig into any stone on the ground or dig down
                                to stone anywhere).
                            </div>
                            <h4>Join Network Game</h4>
                            <div class="uk-text-justify">
                                Simply turn "Network Type" to "Internet" if you want to see servers and hosted games on
                                the internet, turn it to "LAN" to only see servers on your LAN. Turn “Server Type” to
                                “Dedicated” to see dedicated servers, and “Listen” to see locally hosted games. Iron
                                City Games will be running our own dedicated server which you should see in the list and
                                be able to join and play with others. Most maps will start you dropping in from a drop
                                pod. You can control the droppod descent somewhat with the "awsd" keys, "space" will
                                slow your descent, "ctrl" will increase the descent speed. Once the dropod lands, it
                                will break apart and disappear.
                                <br>
                                Now we are on the planet, you might need to defend yourself, change to a weapon by using
                                the mousewheel. You spawn with the standard EM assault rifle for now and your
                                wrist-knives. You will also eventually get or already spawn with a build-gun (the yellow
                                one) that you can mine for resources with, you will need resources to build structures,
                                craft vehicles and weapons and equipment. You can get these by exploring and looking for
                                the outcroppings of different minerals and metals, or by digging in the ground and
                                mining. Once you find the outcropping or just to start digging, equip your build gun
                                (the yellow gun), use your mouse wheel to change weapons, and start digging by hitting
                                the left mouse button. You should see the resources you are collecting start popping up
                                on your message screen.
                                <br>
                                If you bring up your gun configuration menu while you have the build gun equipped (“Q”)
                                you can see the different items you can build and hover the mouse button over them to
                                see the resource requirements. We recommend you build a walled base first! By default,
                                the build gun only shows items you can build with the resources you have. In order to
                                show everything the build gun can build (even if you don't have the resources), you need
                                to click the little settings "gear" in the upper right-hand corner of the window. You
                                can't build anything until you build a "core". A core will set aside your own radious
                                for building a base. Then deselect "Only Show Available Items". There are hundreds of
                                items you can build in GearStorm, so this could show a lot of things. You might want to
                                check "Show Tag Filter Options" also so you can filter by type of item: "Q" brings up
                                gun configuration for other weapons also, not just the buildgun, you can change out your
                                scopes and soon many other options by pressing "Q" with the weapon equipped. After you
                                build, you can create a vehicle factory to spawn vehicles, other special machines to
                                craft items, turrets and many other fun things!
