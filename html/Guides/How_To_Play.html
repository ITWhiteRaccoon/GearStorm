                            Welcome to GearStorm! This manual is a quick-start guide to how to play GearStorm and do
                            certain things in game. It will not completely cover every feature or crafting item as those
                            are covered in more detailed sections.
                            <br>
                            When first running the game, you will see several options on the first screen. If you choose
                            "Host Network Game", "Campaign", or "Survival Mode", you will be playing on your own world
                            on your own PC and you can host other players. If you choose “Join Network Game”, you can
                            play on someone else’s PC that is hosting or a dedicated server.

                        <h4>Join Network Game</h4>
                        <div class="uk-text-justify">
                            Simply turn "Network Type" to "Internet" if you want to see servers and hosted games on the
                            internet, turn it to "LAN" to only see servers on your LAN. Turn “Server Type” to
                            “Dedicated” to see dedicated servers, and “Listen” to see locally hosted games. Iron City
                            Games will be running our own dedicated server which you should see in the list and be able
                            to join and play with others. Most maps will start you dropping in from a drop pod. You can
                            control the droppod descent somewhat with the "awsd" keys, "space" will slow your descent,
                            "ctrl" will increase the descent speed. Once the dropod lands, it will break apart and
                            disappear.
                            <br>
                            Now we are on the planet, you might need to defend yourself, change to a weapon by using the
                            mousewheel. You spawn with the standard EM assault rifle for now and your wrist-knives. You
                            will also eventually get or already spawn with a build-gun (the yellow one) that you can
                            mine for resources with, you will need resources to build structures, craft vehicles and
                            weapons and equipment. You can get these by exploring and looking for the outcroppings of
                            different minerals and metals, or by digging in the ground and mining. Once you find the
                            outcropping or just to start digging, equip your build gun (the yellow gun), use your mouse
                            wheel to change weapons, and start digging by hitting the left mouse button. You should see
                            the resources you are collecting start popping up on your message screen.
                            <br>
                            If you bring up your gun configuration menu while you have the build gun equipped (“Q”) you
                            can see the different items you can build and hover the mouse button over them to see the
                            resource requirements. We recommend you build a walled base first! By default, the build gun
                            only shows items you can build with the resources you have. In order to show everything the
                            build gun can build (even if you don't have the resources), you need to click the little
                            settings "gear" in the upper right-hand corner of the window. You can't build anything until
                            you build a "core". A core will set aside your own radious for building a base. Then
                            deselect "Only Show Available Items". There are hundreds of items you can build in
                            GearStorm, so this could show a lot of things. You might want to check "Show Tag Filter
                            Options" also so you can filter by type of item: "Q" brings up gun configuration for other
                            weapons also, not just the buildgun, you can change out your scopes and soon many other
                            options by pressing "Q" with the weapon equipped. After you build, you can create a vehicle
                            factory to spawn vehicles, other special machines to craft items, turrets and many other fun
                            things!

                            Building in GearStorm is essential for protection early in the game and hording your stuff
                            and keeping it safe later in the game. To building anything that lasts in GearStorm you will
                            first have to build a Core. The Core is the marker that claims the immediate area around it
                            of the server for you and saves your buildings (and protects them if your Gamemaster has
                            turned on Core protection). To build a Core you will need 5 Apatite (found as crystals
                            growing in caves), 10 Copper (mineral outcroppings marked with "Cu" on your map), and 15
                            Stone (just dig into any stone on the ground or dig down to stone anywhere).
