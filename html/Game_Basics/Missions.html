        GearStorm Quest Scripting Guide

        Welcome to the exciting world of GearStorm Quest Editing. As a Game Admin you will have access to shape your world,
        configure your NPCs and their behavior and create intricate experiences for players. So, let’s jump right in.

        First, Quests in GearStorm are a little different. Quests and NPC dialog are part of the same system, interacting
        with NPCs is the main (but not only) way quests move forward in GearStorm. Quests are made up of Stages, and each
        Stage usually has one or more player dialog Responses that may be available if certain conditions are met.

        To start, just Context Activate (Alt-E, or Alt-Middle Mouse) any Base Core and select Quests.<img
            alt="" height="345" src="../../media/Missions_Quest_Editor.png" width="676"/>This will bring up the Quest
        Editor. Quests are made up of several components.
        <ol class="uk-list">
            <li>Name: The name of the Quest as displayed in Dialog</li>
            <li>Tags: Strings that tell NPCs and other objects to make this Quest available in the Dialog. NPCs have
                editable tags as well.
            </li>
            <li>Accessible by admins through their Context Menu (Alt-E)</li>
            <li>Stages: States in the quest, when a quest evaluates in a Dialog, the Dialog will pick the first Stage which
                has a condition that evaluates to true.
            </li>
            <li>Responses: Each stage has an array of responses, these are buttons the player can press IF the response
                condition evaluates to true. Once selected by the player, the Response Execution runs.
            </li>
            <li>Conditions: A set of test commands to evaluate world and player conditions.</li>
            <li>Executions: A set of script commands that invoke changes to the player and the world.</li>
            <li>Texts: Strings displayed as statements from NPCs or as Responses from the player.</li>
            <li>Set: When the quest is started and how often.</li>
        </ol>
        When a player initiates dialog. The player is presented with a list of quests to discuss with an NPC. This list
        is
        created based on the Quest Tags that match the NPCs Tags.
        <img alt="" height="301" src="../../media/Missions_NPC_Tags.png" width="419"/>
        Once the player picks a quest to
        discuss. The Quest Manager will evaluate each stage’s Condition until it finds
        one
        that is true. It will then display that Stage’s text along with a list of Responses. Each response also has a
        condition. The player only has the response option if the response conditions are met. E.g. To turn in a quest
        item.
        If the player then selects a response, the response’s Execution is run. This can change variables, add or remove
        items from player inventory and many other things that change the game environment. Once this is done, the
        execution
        can either close the dialog or the stage selection process if repeated.

        Conditions and Executions have differing sets of commands. More listed on the next Page.

        <strong>Quest Sets: </strong>This is important. When a quest starts is determined by the Quest Set variable.
        <ol class="uk-list">
            <li>None: The quest will never start, used for quests under development</li>
            <li>Manual: The Quest can only be started from a script</li>
            <li>Random: The quest will start randomly, added to the list of available random quests</li>
            <li>Rare: The quest will start randomly, but much less frequently than other random quests</li>
            <li>Startup: Start Immediately and every time the server starts</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Condition Statements</h4>Condition statements exist to test game and player state. Statements can be compound,
        that is multiple
        conditions
        can be added to a statement. These are separated by a Semicolon “;” or New Line. If statements are compound,
        all
        must be true for the condition to be true. Blank statements always evaluate to true. Any line that is
        non-zero is
        considered to be true. Conditions are not case sensitive.
        <h4>Condition Functions</h4>
        <ol class="uk-list">
            <li>IsDay - Returns true if is daylight, else false</li>
            <li>IsNight – Returns true if dark, else false</li>
            <li>GetSunlightLevel – Returns brightness of sunlight, 0=False for night</li>
            <li>HasItem [Item_Name / Item#] [#Count] - Returns count of item in player inventory if >= #Count else
                returns
                0
            </li>
            <li>PlayerStat [StatName] - Returns the number of the player stat, available StatNames are
                <ol class="uk-list">
                    <li>HEALTH HEALTHRATIO MAXHEALTH</li>
                    <li>STAMINA STAMINARATIO MAXSTAMINA</li>
                    <li>SHIELD SHIELDRATIO MAXSHIELD</li>
                    <li>ARMOR ARMORRATIO MAXARMOR</li>
                    <li>POWER POWERRATIO MAXPOWER</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Variables</h4>$[VarName] - Variable indicator, Variables are set in the Execution stage and can be referenced
        here
        <h4>Operators</h4>[+,-,*,/,!,%,&] operators can be used in conjunction with Variables and other Condition
        functions
        <h4>Comparison operators</h4>[=,==,>,<,>=,<=,!=] These are evaluated after other functions to produce true/false
        values.

        Examples:
        <ol class="uk-list">
            <li>$MyHealthVar >= PlayerStat Health;</li>
            <li>HasItem Gold_Ore $MinimumGoldOre</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Execution Statements</h4>Execution statements make things happen in the game or to the player. Like condition
        statements, these are separated
        by a Semicolon “;” or New Line. Execution statements are not case sensitive.
        <h4>Execution Functions</h4>
        <ol class="uk-list">
            <li>Close – Closes Dialog Menu</li>
            <li>SetMenuMode [Mode] changes to a separate menu mode. Currently available modes are:

            <li>Set [VarName] [Value] Defines a variable, Condition functions can be used
                to determine Value
            </li>
            <li>StartQuest [QuestName] Starts a Manual quest based on its Name string (use
                “_” for spaces in Quest Name)

        <h4>Location Designation</h4>

        Missions are one of the key features of GearStorm. There are a built-in
        number of missions available in the game,
        however, gamemasters will also be able to create and develop their own
        missions.
