<h3>Phage</h3>The Phage is a deadly nano-virus that has been decimating the human population and you must fight
against it in
GearStorm.

The Phage is a virulent genetically-engineered biological weapon that weaponized the infected into rageful
bio-mechanical horrors that spread the plague and death. The unstoppable Phage spread like wildfire through man and
beast alike. With no way to undo what was done, the remnants of humankind retreated into bunkers, or walled cities,
and fortresses. But even these, one by one fell to the Phage.
