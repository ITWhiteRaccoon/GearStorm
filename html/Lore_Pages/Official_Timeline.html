BEGIN In the 2100’s AD, mankind was in a golden age of technological advancements. However, Earth was beset by
over-population, waning planetary resources, and growing food scarcity. With our new power-sources and biomedical
advances, we looked once more to the stars for our future.

The first permanent moon base was constructed in 2141 AD. It was named the Tetragon for the four super-powers of the
time (USA, Russia, The E.U., and China) who jointly funded it. It was meant to be a stellar assembly and launch
facility for the larger of our dreams.

The peaceful age held together and by the 2150’s, thanks to the Tetragon facility, mankind boasted numerous stable
colonies on Mars. Though the Red Planet’s colonies were small for they were dependent upon Earth for resupply and
their low gravity made long-term residency difficult. Still, they were hailed as proof we could make it beyond
Earth.

Many ambitious projects were started to search the stars for a colonizable world and just as many “colonization
tech” projects were started on the ground and at the Tetragon base. In this era, we learned how to store skills and
memories and how to grow clones of ourselves.

In 2156 AD, the Automated Kepler Systems Array--the humblest of exploration projects--made a historic discovery. It
was a planet with an Earth-Similarity Index of 0.98, almost perfect.

Nanoprobes were dispatched at 18% the speed of light and their readings of the planet returned to Earth in 2191 AD.
They were far more than we expected. By all readings and deductions, this new world had a fully functioning,
human-compatible biosphere with breathable air. And it was only about twelve light-years away.

The automated system chose a name from its donor-determined list and mankind’s miracle second Earth was name
Apollyon. But the miracle wouldn’t last.

The prize of Apollyon was too rich for the international peace to withstand. Nationalistic movements gained power
from the over-crowded populations who were desperate to claim the open frontier of Apollyon for themselves.
Demagogues gained power and diplomacy was replaced by posturing as powerful once-allies rattled their sabers at each
other.

By 2196 AD, the world was in a state of multiple cold wars between the four powers. Proxy wars over smaller nations
and ideologies caught fire across the globe. Fearing for their safety, the many nations of Earth began to spin a
horrible web of hidden alliances and defensive treaties.

In 2197 AD, the Secretary-General of the UN, fearing that global war was nearing, held an immense diplomatic summit
at the Tetragon moon base. Called The Reminder Speech ingloriously, it was a heavy-handed affair which desperately
tried to focus the world’s leaders on what they could do together.

The summit worked initially. The G20 leaders present ratified an international treaty banning all independent
colonization efforts. They promised that all would reach Apollyon, or none would. To that end, the International
Colonization Authority was founded and charged with the task of starting a colony on Apollyon. All participating
countries donated funds, manpower, and resources to it and the effort was placed under the UN’s oversight.

But peace was not to be had. Even with the biggest countries on Earth in outward agreement, many others would not
listen. Political tensions continued to rise. By 2199 AD, numerous countries around the world started developing
militarized space forces, in violation of all treaties counter to such. In the end, everyone knew the first to get
to Apollyon would have a chance at winning it all.

2200 AD, was a big year for the UN’s peace push. Using the century anniversary as a coming together moment, the UN
made a huge show of giving the ICA full ownership of the Tetragon Moon Base for use in constructing the first legal
colony ship – The Vanguard. Assembly of the titanic vessel began that same year, albeit at a rushed pace for the
show.

For a few months, people breathed easily. Then, in 2201 AD, a military satellite was accidentally shot down by
another country’s space force during routine practice. The circumstances of who was at fault aren’t clear, but the
international incident nearly brought the two countries to war.

Before hands could shake on a de-escalation meeting, the country who owned the satellite used the international
focus on the peace talks to launch an illegal colony ship from Earth. It’s neighbor’s missile system shot the craft
down, raining debris over a coastal city, lighting fires, and killing hundreds.

By the next year, 2203 AD, both countries were building up troops on their borders and skirmishes by deniable proxy
troops were already heating up the theater of war. Peace talks failed in 2204 AD when a war was officially declared
as a means of stopping the one county’s illegal colonization program.

This war triggered defensive treaties, which triggered hidden accords. The worrisome web of confusing and secretive
agreements dragged the whole world down to war. Allies and enemies switched sides rapidly in the first year as the
battle lines resolved.

Full-scale global war truly started in 2205 AD, when a nuclear exchange went down between super-powers. Then another
super-power revealed that it had broken the ban on robotic armies. Everyone with illegal colonization programs tried
to flee Earth and a series of brutal executions of their ships were televised from space as deterrents.

Around 2207 AD, nuclear weapons had driven the war underground or into bunkered mountain cities. Robot armies
clashed across the radioactive wastelands of Earth’s surface while people fought savage battles in tunnel-warfare.
World War 3 reached a gridlock.

Looking to break the deadlock, someone created a biological weapon. Who it was is lost, or perhaps unknown, to
history. The Phage they created, however, was the ultimate weapon.

The Phage spread by multiple vectors. It incubated for weeks without symptoms. Detecting it was expensive and
difficult, especially for the war-taxed medical systems. When it did manifest, the Phage would erupt from its
victims as it transformed them into violent, hyper-strong zombie-like monsters.

Within a year of its start, by 2209 AD, the phage had put an end to World War 3. We were forced to stop fighting
each other and instead battle the uncountable hordes of phage. The fate of mankind was on the line.

In 2210 AD, Mars declared itself independent of Earth and rallied its merger space force to enact a blockage. This
action ended what little resupply the Martian colonies had been receiving from Earth still and the Red Planet’s
colonies descended into one of the most brutal famines in human history.

Around 2212 AD, the phage infections caught fire on one of the moon’s several military bases. Fearing that the end
of mankind was near, the ICA staff at the Tetragon declared their independence and cut off all contact with the
outside world. They proceeded to pour all remaining resources into getting the Vanguard launch ready.

On Oct 13th, 2213 AD, the second to last moon base falls to the Phage and the ICA turns to defend their stronghold
alone. The battle is hopeless though. The ICA, short on enough fuel to get the Vanguard to Apollyon, makes a
monumental decision – the Vanguard wouldn’t carry people to Apollyon, but it would carry the means of making people
once it gets there.

The once glorious Vanguard was stripped bare. Only the bioprinters, cloning technology, and cloning materials were
left. Instead of sending mankind’s greatest minds into space, the skills and memories of ICA’s best personnel were
recorded instead. In the care of an AI named Julia, the ship was launched mere hours before the phage overwhelmed
the Tetragon’s defenses. Bearing with it the tiny Flickering flame believed to be the last spark of humankind.

In 2226 AD, the last remaining military forces on Earth band together to form the Earth Defense Initiative (EDI).
Acting as the world’s government, the Commanders Council of the EDI enacts the New Horizon initiative. A global
nuclear purge of the phage.

By 2228 AD, the EDI’s surface forces are able to drive the devastated phage into scattered pockets around the Earth.
Additional technological advances finally yield an immunity to the phage as well. The EDI announces that the war is
finally over.

Five years later, the EDI declares global peace has been obtained. To mark the first time that all people stand
united under the same banner, the Commanders Council sets its sights on claiming the prize which nearly caused our
extinction. Massive colonization programs for Apollyon start up the very next year.

Over the next decade, the EDI launches several large-scale military colonization fleets to Apollyon. However, the
programs don’t run much beyond that. Environmental rehabilitation costs for Earth and rising social issues plague
the EDI and its resources are redirected towards the ground instead of the stars.

By 2336 AD the Earth Defense Initiative government collapses.

In 2237 AD, the Martian government, having survived in isolation all these years from Earth, attempts to contact the
mother planet. Their attempts are met by automated hostilities. The planet itself seems to exhibit a lack of
civilized activity. Martian historians label this time as “The Stillness”.

In 2401 AD, the Martian Science Foundation (MSF), a space-oriented research group on Mars, whips up a case for
sending a colonial expedition to Apollyon. As Mars suffers from tremendously low biodiversity, and the Martians are
cut-off from Earth, the MSF proposes that biological data can be transmitted back from Apollyon’s researchers at
light speed and then reproduced on Mars.

Funding is approved, though not much funding. The MSF builds a mass-driver launch facility and fires a series of
very tiny human-printing drones to Apollyon. While the program is low-budget, it benefits from some of the best
technology on Mars at this time as donors are keen to have first rights to biological discovers with commercial
value at home.

Martian history ends in 2501 AD when The Stillness is suddenly broken. The last known details are that Mars is
immediately subsumed by the explosive growth of the Sol-Terra Imperium.

Very little is known about the Sol-Terra Imperium other than that they are the height of human technological
advancement in all of history. At some point, they run a colonization program on the (now) legendary Apollyon.
Ironically, due to technological differences, they are the first to arrive to the virgin planet. The Sol-Terra
Expedition (STE) beats the EDI colonization ships to Apollyon by centuries, they beat the MSF there by nearly a
millennium, and they beat the ICA by even more.

Little is known about their colonies or society however as the STE colonization program on Apollyon ends or
collapses, no one is sure, several hundred years before the EDI arrives. There is little more than ruins and ancient
facilities left of the STE on Apollyon now. The Sol-Terra Imperium has no active presence either and its fate is
likewise unknown to those on Apollyon.

Apollyon's More Recent History
Around 3230 AD the first EDI colonization fleet arrives. The colony of Northpoint is established and forms the
capital of the EDI government on Apollyon. More colonization fleets arrive in following years and colonies such as
Wake Station, and Satellite Station (later renamed to ImmortalTown) are created.

For nearly 100 years, the EDI flourishes on Apollyon. The human population of the planet reaches several million by
3330 AD.

It all comes to an end when the Phage re-emerges. Carried latently by the immune EDI population, a strain of the
phage merges with a local Apollyon virus. This new strain erupts violently and the phage war suddenly reignites
after it’s thousand-year lull.

The EDI capital, Northpoint colony, is swept under by the phage assault in 3332 AD and by the next year, the EDI
government ruling Apollyon collapses.

The war from there is messy. The EDI remnants dig in and the Phage are not so numerous as they were on Earth. But
the phage starts infecting some species of animals and gains larger forces that way. The remnant’s biotechnicians
reestablish human herd-immunity in some locations, but not others due to the fracturing. The phage mutates again and
the cycle continues.

In 3413 AD, the first Martian Science Foundation (MSF) probe arrives on Apollyon. Its burgeoning colony discovers
the low-grade war of scrappy city-states struggling to live while also keeping an ever-pressing phage menace at bay.

Lacking the EDI-descended immunity (the phage never made it to Mars), the first MSF colony never gets off the
ground. Infection and assault destroy it within a few months. The following colony ship learns of this and sets down
in a remote and inaccessible region, establishing the MSF colony of Skywatch.

Learning from the mistakes of the previous colony, Skywatch establishes trade with the EDI remnant town Wake
Station. The MSF trades its superior technology for help with phage immunity development methods as well as
resources and mercenaries. Neither colony likes the other very much, but they get by.

The MSF colony of Skywatch, once established, begins its task of analyzing biological data and transmitting packages
of information back to Mars. Little do they know that the Martian government is long gone.

More probes from Mars arrive on time and the Endor colony is established. With help from Skywatch, this colony grows
quickly, much to the alarm of Wake Station. Eager to curb the growth of the technologically superior MSF colonies,
Wake Station spies provoke a war between the Endor colony and the barbaric ImmortalTown.

The Endor colony eventually sues for peace but owes Immortaltown a brutal tribute as the price. This buys peace for
a while. Long enough for the last MSF probe to land and create the colony of New Atlanta. Things are looking up for
an MSF resurgence when the researchers at Endor discover STE ruins.

The EDI-descended city-states of Apollyon have long known about the STE’s advanced ruins. However, they have learned
the hard way to leave them be. The MSF, seeing the ultimate prize their mission to Apollyon could ever achieve,
cannot resist. The second MSF expedition into the STE ruins activates an ancient guardian defense system. It wipes
out the research team but then it detects the latent phage virus in their DNA. This triggers the system to enact a
global purge campaign. Or it tries to anyway, it’s really old.

The geriatric defense system runs amok, destroying the Endor colony and heavily damaging Skywatch and Wake Station.
EDI and MSF join forces to put the system down before it can fully repair itself and active a true purge of all
phage infections.

Afterward, the three factions dissolve into blame and fighting. Wake Station vows that it will never allow the MSF
to tinker with STE anything ever again, and will regard such going’s on as an act of war.

Immortaltown cares less about the mess that was caused and much more about how the MSF saved them during one of the
battles, at the cost of the tribute agreement. Immortaltown feels that tribute is still owed them and is sore about
the whole deal. Now they raid the MSF regularly to recoup.

The survivors of the Endor colony fled south and reestablished themselves as the less glamorous Swamp Town.

The MSF cannot resist the siren call of the STE though. Especially now that they’ve determined that something has
happened to Mars. The scheduled communications from Mars never arrived as they should have. The MSF theorizes that
the STE had an FTL method of travel and they hungrily seek it so that they may one day find out what happened. They
dream of returning to Mars covered in the glory of STE technology. Some research factions within the MSF have
started worshipping the STE as technologically ascended human-made gods. This is a worrisome trend for everyone.

All three factions are uneasy about each other. Immortaltown’s role can change quickly depending on how brutal,
greedy, or restrained it’s current dictator is. The brutal town tends to change leaders every few years via coup or
assassination, so both the MSF and EDI Wake Station watch its internal politics with nervous eyes.

Wake Station wants stability in the region and just wishes that Immortaltown would die and that it could rule the
MSF so as to stop them from constantly poking their noses into dangerous waters. Wake Station secretly believes that
the MSF could put an end to the phage if they worked at it.

And then, into this barely stable mix, in the year 3613 AD, the ICA Vanguard arrives into orbit.

It’s safe to say that none of the factions on the ground will be happy to have another visitor from Earth.
Particularly one with a massive ship in orbit. Wake Station’s immediate fears focus on the military strike
capabilities the Vanguard might possess. It wants to destroy the Vanguard before the ICA can use it to rule with.
The EDI cultures have had a growing xenophobia due to the MSF troubles in the past, this trend has accelerated with
the arrive of the ICA.

Immortaltown sees the technologically inferior ICA colony as an easy target. Someone new that they might be able to
get under their boot to serve them.

The MSF cares little for the ICA colony itself. Instead, they wish to gain access and control over the Vanguard. Not
only do they want to know what happened to Mars, but they see it as an irreplaceable orbital research platform that
would greatly expand their ability to survey Apollyon for STE structures and dormant facilities.

The ICA is in the cross-hairs of greed, suspicion, and reckless progress-at-all-costs. None of whom seem to care
about making a better future for mankind on Apollyon itself.
