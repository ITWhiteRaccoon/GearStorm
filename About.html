                        GearStorm is an upcoming game currently in development by Iron City Games.
                        <br>
                        It takes place in a militarized science fiction sandbox in which players cooperate and compete to
                        colonize and fortify their positions on a hostile alien planet. GearStorm takes place on an huge,
                        open, procedural, and entirely destructible world. Here players can advance and customize their
                        technology to improve their chances against each other and the Phage – a deadly nano-virus that is
                        decimating human population.

                            prone, crouch and tactically useful concealment from grass and brush. You can hide, you can
                            sneak, you can snipe people from almost a kilometer away
                        </li>
                        <li>Advanced weapons: GearStorm will have a massive selection of advanced, futuristic weapons.
                            Lasers, flamethrowers, electromagnetic slug-throwers and smart rockets are just a few of the
                            weapons that have been put into the game.
                        </li>
                        <li>Gear: GearStorm will focus on gear the player can have and how that effects the player’s

                        <li>Open, fully-destructible worlds with destructible terrain, rocks and vegetation. When you make
                            a hole in GearStorm, it will persist. You can did a base into the ground or a mountainside. You
                            can mine for materials, make labyrinths, or dig trenches and tunnels for combat.

                        <li>Building: You can build almost anything in GearStorm using our extensive library of building
                            materials, bridges, walls, battlements, windows, doors, garages to keep your vehicles. You can
                            build lights, doors and windows that open based on switching commands and a wireless control
                            scheme. Build bases you can fight from, towers to snipe from and garages to horde your vehicles
                            and gear. Bases will be attacked for some reasons, but will have limited destructibility so you
                            can’t just lose the base you have been building for days from one attack.
                        </li>
                        <li>Quests: GearStorm will have a rich quest system with bounties that can be put on players, types

                        <li>Gamemaster-admins: GearStorm will have a gamemaster-admin role for each server that allows the
                            players the server owner designates to teleport, spawn items or vehicles, teleport players to
                            them, god mode and fly. This will let server admins control the experience on their server,
                            help players, create events and create missions. GearStorm will also allow the gamemaster-admin
                            to kick or ban players from their server, set weapon damage and range for their server, or
                            change what vehicles are available and their speed, range and weapons. This role will let a
                            non-technical server admin create a unique experience for players on their server.

                <div class="uk-card-body">
                    In the year, 2185, the human race is in its final death throes. Earth itself is a desolate waste,
                    ravaged by decades of war. War, more malignant, more savage than any conceived of before. War fueled by
                    diverging ideologies, waning resources, and drastic technology advances of the 21st century. For years,
                    humanity bathed itself in blood, fire and death.The final death knell came in the form of the Phage.
                    A virulent genetically-engineered biological weapon that weaponized the infected into rageful
                    bio-mechanical horrors that spread the plague and death. The unstoppable Phage spread like wildfire
                    through man and beast alike. With no way to undo what was done, the remnants of humankind retreated
                    into bunkers, or walled cities, and fortresses. But even these, one by one fell to the Phage.
                    <br><br>
                    With Earth all but lost, a glimmer of hope was discovered. Automated Kepler systems that had been in
                    operation for nearly a century discovered an extremely unlikely, human habitable extraterrestrial world.
                    These probes reported amazing findings dozens of light-years away on a planet dubbed as Apollyon.
                    Apollyon was a small earth-like planet with isolated continents in a large ocean. These islands showed
                    signs of ecosystems, flora and fauna.
                    <br><br>
                    The mad rush to escape this hellish Earth, lead to tragic mishap and loss. Previous attempts to send
                    manned generation ships to Apollyon failed either due to infighting or mechanical failure. In a final
                    act of desperation, small, unmanned probes, fitted with advanced bio-printers were launched to seed
                    Apollyon to save the species. These probes were encoded with the DNA and mental recordings of the
                    finest of our remnants and cast off towards the planet.
                    <br><br>
                    You are one of these ghosts, a fabricant sent to an alien world to renew humanity. You carry the hopes
                    and legacy of us all. Remember us.
